# 📊 Data Analysis Using Pandas

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and Pandas on customer and transaction datasets.  
The objective of the project is to analyze customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance through data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization.

This project follows an internship-style workflow similar to the Internshala Data Analysis module.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The analysis is performed using two datasets:

### 1️⃣ customer_data_.csv
Contains customer-related information:

- Customer ID  
- Name  
- Age  
- Gender  
- Country  
- Account Balance  

### 2️⃣ transaction_data_.csv
Contains transaction-related information:

- Transaction ID  
- Customer ID  
- Product  
- Quantity  
- Total Price  
- Transaction Date  

Both datasets are merged using **Customer ID**.

## 📊 Data Visualization

Data visualization was performed using **Matplotlib** to convert numerical insights into clear and meaningful graphical representations.

The following charts were created as part of the analysis:

### 🔹 Total Sales by Gender
A bar chart showing comparison of total revenue generated by male and female customers.

### 🔹 Quantity Sold by Gender
Visualizes the total number of products purchased by each gender group.

### 🔹 Total Sales by Country
Displays country-wise contribution to total sales revenue, helping identify high-performing regions.

### 🔹 Quantity Sold by Product
Shows which products were sold in higher quantities, enabling product demand analysis.

### 🔹 Total Sales by Product
Compares revenue generated by each product category.

These visualizations help in:
- Identifying customer purchasing patterns  
- Understanding regional sales performance  
- Comparing product demand and revenue contribution  
- Supporting business decisions through visual insights  

All plots were generated using Pandas built-in plotting functions backed by Matplotlib.
